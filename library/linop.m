%LINOP Allocates a linear operator given function handles computing the
%mapping and adjoint mapping.
%
%   LINOP(op, adj, m, n) builds the linear operator defined by MATLAB
%   function handles op (computing the operator) and adj (computing the
%   adjoint operator). Parameters m and n are respectively the dimensions
%   of the target space and domain of op.
%   
%   All parameters are compulsory.
